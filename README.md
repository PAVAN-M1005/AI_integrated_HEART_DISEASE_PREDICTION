🩺 Heart Health Predictor Web Application

🌟 Overview

The Heart Health Predictor is a modern, interactive web application designed to assess the risk of heart disease in individuals based on various clinical parameters. It utilizes a Machine Learning model (likely a Logistic Regression or similar classifier trained with scikit-learn) to provide a probability-based prediction.

This application is built with Streamlit for the frontend and backend logic, SQLite for user and prediction data storage, and includes powerful AI capabilities via the OpenRouter API for advice and image analysis.

✨ Features

Risk Prediction: Predict the probability of heart disease using a trained ML model.

AI Vision Analysis: Upload images (like ECGs or scans) for basic AI interpretation.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration for individual user accounts.

Prediction History: Users can track and review all their past health predictions.

Data Persistence: Stores user details and prediction results in an SQLite database.

Responsive UI: An engaging and modern user interface that works well on desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need the following installed:

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

⚙️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment running.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/heart-health-predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/heart-health-predictor.git)
cd heart-health-predictor



2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Create environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate



3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages from the newly generated requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt



4. Train the Machine Learning Model

The application requires trained model files (heart_disease_model.pkl, heart_disease_scaler.pkl, and model_features.pkl) to function. These are generated by running the training script, which uses the provided heart.csv dataset.

Note: The file train_model.py is assumed to exist. If it doesn't, you will need to create it to generate the necessary model assets.

# Assuming you have a train_model.py file:
python train_model.py



5. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit web server:

streamlit run app.py



The application will now be running. You can access it in your web browser at the address provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
